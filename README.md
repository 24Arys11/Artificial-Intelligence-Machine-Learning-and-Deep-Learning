# Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Here I will be uploading Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning related projects.

## Further clarifications:

### Artificial Intelligence:

This cathegory will include projects based on algorithms such as: A*, Min-Max and/or Alpha-beta, Q-Learning...

### Machine Learning

This cathegory will include projects based on algorithms such as: Linear Regression, Naive-Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forests and even Neural Networks.

### Deep Learning

This cathegory will include projects based on Neural Networks such as: Image recognition, Speach recognition (such as Hate Speach classification), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)...
